  I have been processing some thoughts about creativity for a long time now. I thought I would finally put pen to paper and see what happens. It is funny how you get to a point when you suddenly realise the amount of influences that can bear down on your mind and decision-making. You start to say and do things, which you realise later, that weren’t actually yourself. You can normally tell as you end up going down a path where you start to feel claustrophobic or stifled. This is the indicator and alarm bell to my recent situation.

  So what is the solution to the problem? A paradigm shift or 360 degree turn so to speak. Most probably! I have been finding myself in this predicament recently where what I believed to be my thoughts were actually external.

  I do believe we are so much more creative then we allow ourselves to be. This doesn’t imply we have to be free spirited hippies living to paint or write poetry for the rest of our lives. But that is okay if you want to. What I mean is having a sense of exploration and discovery amongst our own talents and gifting’s and being bold enough to explore that. Only recently I have started to wonder whether I have some entrepreneurial ideas as I have recently started a business and explored some ideas that have been playing on my mind for so long now. Before it was not on my radar as the voice inside my head immediately dismissed it.

  I have come up with some guidelines, which may be helpful to anyone reading this.

  1.	Be yourself
  2.	Let go
  3.	Listen to the right voices. Firstly yours and then the ones you trust.
  4.	Think practically how to get there.
  5.	Don’t be scared to make mistakes.

  I actually think the last one is one of the best. Mistakes are so crucial in some areas of life to help us move on and make progress. I know this is something I particular do a lot and am thankful for.
